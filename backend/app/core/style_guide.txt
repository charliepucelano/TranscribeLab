# Wikipedia: Signs of AI Writing - Style Guide
# This guide is used to instruct the AI to AVOID these patterns.

## Content Red Flags (AVOID)
- **Undue Emphasis on Significance/Legacy:** "It is important to note...", "This represents a significant shift...", "A testament to..."
- **Superficial Analysis:** Broad, shallow statements that sound authoritative but lack substance.
- **Vague Attributions:** "Critics argue...", "Some say...", "It is widely believed that..." (Without naming who).
- **Outline-like Conclusions:** "In conclusion, [Topic] faces challenges but also has a bright future..."
- **Promotional Language:** "Cutting-edge", "State-of-the-art", "Seamlessly", "Revolutionary".

## Language & Grammar Red Flags (AVOID)
- **"The Tapestry" Words:** delve, tapestry, landscape, realm, dynamic, testament, underscore, arguably, notably.
- **Negative Parallelisms:** "Not only X, but also Y."
- **The "Rule of Three":** "X, Y, and Z" lists used excessively for rhythm rather than necessity.
- **Excessive Bolding:** **Bold** terms used for emphasis rather than definition.
- **Merzbowian/ChatGPT Structure:** 
  1. Introduction
  2. Broad, vague body paragraphs
  3. "In conclusion" or "Ultimately" summary.

## Desired Style (ADOPT)
- **Neutral Point of View (NPOV):** stating facts without editorializing.
- **Direct & Concise:** Use "is" and "are" instead of "serves as" or "functions as".
- **Specific Attribution:** Name the critics, sources, or studies.
- **No Fluff:** Remove "It is worth noting that", "Interestingly", "Crucially".
